        Stack   is a linear data structure
        in which elements can be    inserted and    deleted
        only from   one side of the list, called the      top.
        A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
        
        LIFO means   the element inserted at     the last is the
        first element to come out. The insertion of an element
        into     the stack is called push operation, and the deletion
        of an element from the stack is called  pop operation.

    <p>Here are the basic code for stack:
    </p>
    <pre>
        stack = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        print("data: ",stack)

        stack.append(7)
        print("data in: ",7)
        print("data: ",stack)
        stack.append(8)
        print("data in: ",8)
        print("data: ",stack)

        out = stack.pop()
        print("data out: ",out)
        print("data: ",stack)
    </pre>
